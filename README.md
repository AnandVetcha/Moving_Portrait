Tips:
1) UltraSonic Sensor and Servo motor worked flawlessly with 3.3V. I didnt find any reason to power it using 5W
2) Prefer Arduino IDE installation through EXE file. During installation prefer dir where active OneDrive backup is not enable (Eg C drive). I observed that comilation errors got resolved when Arduino IDE installation ares doenot have active OneDrive backup.
